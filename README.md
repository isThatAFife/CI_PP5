  ## User Experience (UX)

  ### Project Goals

    This application aims to provide a comprehensive list of games for multiple platforms, and allow the user to see both an aggregated review score (metascore), and also an average user score. It also aims to allow users to leave their own comments and reviews for their favourite games and in the future will also allow them to contribute their own scores to be added to the 'userscore' field of each game page.

## User Stories

### Admin

- As a site admin I can add, modify and delete game entries so that I can curate the library.
- As a site admin I can approve or disapprove comments so that I can filter out objectionable comments.
- As a Site Admin, I can create or update the about page content so that it is available on the site.

### User

- As a Site User, I can click on the About link so that I can read about the site.
- As a site user I can view a list of games so that I can find my favourites.

## Deployment & Local Development

### Deployment

The deployment of the project was done using [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) through the following steps.

1. Log in to Heroku or create an account if necessary.
2. Click on the button labeled "New" from the dashboard in the top right corner and select the "Create new app" option in the drop-down menu.
3. Enter a unique name for the application and select the region you are in.
   * For this project, the unique name is "g4m3b0x" and the region selected is Europe.
4. Click on "create app".
5. Navigate to the settings tab and locate the "Config Vars" section and click "Reveal config vars".
6. Add config vars: 
   * For this project I have four config vars:
     * DATABASE_URL - For the database
     * SECRET_KEY - Password for accessing database
     * IGDB_ID - ID to access IGDB API
     * IGDB_SECRET - Password to access IGDB API
7. Navigate to the "Deploy" section by clicking the "Deploy" tab in the top navbar.
8. Select "GitHub" as the deployment method and click "Connect to GitHub".
9. Search for the GitHub repository name in the search bar.
10. Click on "connect" to link the repository to Heroku.
11. Scroll down and click on "Deploy Branch".
12. Once the app is deployed, Heroku will notify you and provide a button to view the app.

NB - If you wish to rebuild the deployed app automatically every time you push to GitHub, you may click on "Enable Automatic Deploys".

### How to Fork

This can be done to create a copy of the repository. The copy can be viewed and edited without affecting the original repository.

To fork the repository through GitHub, take the following steps:
1. In the "CI_PP4" repository, click on the "fork" tab in the top right corner.
2. Click on "create fork" to fork the repository.

### How to Clone

To clone the repository through GitHub:

1. In the repository, select the "code" tab located just above the list of files and next to the gitpod button.
2. Ensure HTTPS is selected in the dropdown menu.
3. Copy the URL under HTTPS.
4. Open Git Bash in your IDE of choice.
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be created.
6. Type "git clone" and paste the URL that was copied from the repository.
7. Press the "enter" key to create the clone.

### APIs
In order for the app to function properly, APIs need to be set up and connected. In particular, the following APIs were used for this project:

* IGDB API:
  * This was used in order to retrieve box art for games

## Testing

Testing was ongoing throughout the build.

### Python PEP8 Testing

I used the Code Institute Python Linter to check for syntax and styling errors and found none.

### Solved Bugs

1. While trying to apply a database migration I got the error: django.db.utils.DataError: invalid input syntax for type numeric: "tbd". This happened because I changed the parameters of the userscore field and it would no longer accept the value 'tbd' from the dataset. I was able to use pgAdmin 4 to find the relevant entries and change all instances of 'tbd' to 0.

2. Whenever I attempted to delete a comment as a logged in user, the website would delete that comment but then post an identical one at the same time. This turned out to be a conflict between the post comment and delete comment in the game detail view. To fix this, I added an if statement inside the submit comment function to ensure the POST request was specifically for submitting a new comment, and not for any other reason (like deletion).

3. Users were initially unable to access their 'My Comments' page. This turned out to be an issue with the ordering of paths in urls.py. The were rearranged in order to fix this bug.

### Known Bugs

1. No known bugs at this time.
